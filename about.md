## Abstract
Most introductory biologv classes are tailored toward visual and auditory learners, leaving kinesthetic learners hehind. By developing physical,3D printed models of various biological macromolecules, this proiect aims to bridge the gap between learning styles. Additionally, to increase educational opportunities for all, we aim to create supplementary materials that all
studonts would be able to access. So far, approximately 20 models have been printed but more are currently being planned.
## Methodology
Based on professor feedback for what molecules they would like modeled, we search PDB for suitable x-ray crystallography data. From there, the data can be visualized and manipulated in UCSF Chimera. Based on professor feedback and reviews of the primary literature, models are built to certain specifications. Depending on what is being done, models are then printed or used to create the supplementany materials. Some models are more difficult than others and will require extra processing with VMD and Blender.

## Results
My proiect has resulted in the development of many "Figure Shepts" and digital versions of
the 3D printed models, which can be found on this website. Currently, Figure Sheets have been
created for every model approximately 25% of the models have digital versions with multiple
renresentations.

## Future Directions
Overall, the goal of this project is to expand our library of models and the supplementary materials associated with each model. Currently, the types of supplementary materials that exist for each model are the Figure Sheets, Infographics, Animations, and Digital Models.
We hope to create new forms of materials that would aid more students in their
education. Additionally, we aim to expand this project to more schools, and that begins with building a website like this one. I have already begun collaborating with a Computer Science student to build out a website that can host all our digital materials, as well as instructions to 3D print models
