<h1>WELCOME TO TOUCH THE INVISIBLE</h1>
 <p class="text-justify">
   In most introductory biology courses, the teaching is tailored towards visual and auditory learners, leaving kinesthetic learners behind. Touch the Invisible aims to develop physical, 3D printed models of various biological macromolecules in an effort to bridge the gap between learning styles. By utilzing x-ray crystallographic data from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) and special software to manipulate the structures, Touch the Invisible has produced multiple models ranging from gramicidin to phosphofructokinase, many of which have already been introduced into several classes at the <a href="pitt.edu">University of Pittsburgh</a>. In addition, this project also involves researching the molecules which are modeled, then producing supplementary material to aid students in learning. So far, approximately 20 molecules have been modeled and developed, but more are currently in the works. We hope to build an extensive library of models and supplementary models that can be expanded to more classes and more universities.
