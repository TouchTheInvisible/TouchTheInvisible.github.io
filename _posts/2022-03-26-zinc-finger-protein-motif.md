Zinc-finger motifs are small proteins that appear in a variety of distinct, unrelated molecules. They contains one or more zinc ions that stabilize the way the protein folds around DNA. Zinc-fingers bind to DNA and acts as transcription factors, regulating DNA transcription (synthesis of RNA from a DNA template). They are also found in proteins involved in DNA repair, RNA binding, protein degradation, and signal transduction.
