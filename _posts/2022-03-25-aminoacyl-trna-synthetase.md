Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases are enzymes that link amino acids to their cognate tRNAs, forming aminoacyl-tRNAs (a process called “aa-charging”). Using the energy from ATP hydrolysis, an AARS catalyzes covalent bond formation between the tRNA and its amino acid. These charged aminoacyl-tRNAs bring amino acids to ribosomes for protein production. AARSs are ubiquitously expressed by all forms of life. In addition to biosynthesis, AARSs are also involved in regulation of gene expression, intron splicing, development, and activation of immune system.
