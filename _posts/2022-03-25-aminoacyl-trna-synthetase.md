Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase is an enzyme that has a binding site specific for a particular amino acid and its corresponding tRNA. With the energy from the hydrolysis of ATP, this enzyme forms a covalent bond between the tRNA and its amino acid, and this complex is then used in the process of protein translation. It is ubiquitously expressed by all forms of life, and are also involved in regulating gene expression and splicing introns. This model specifically depicts glyutaminyl-tRNA synthetase, a specific type that binds the amino acid glutamine.
