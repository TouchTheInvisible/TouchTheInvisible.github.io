Phosphofructokinase regulates glycolysis, a carbohydrate metabolism energy pathway, by feedback inhibition, as its activity is regulated by the presence of ATP, which is a product of the process. If there are high levels of ATP, ATP binds to its allosteric site, inhibiting it. Otherwise, this enzyme transfers a phosphoryl group in the third step of glycolysis allowing the efficient production of ATP as needed. This enzyme is found in the cytoplasm of bacterial, plant, fungal, animal cells.
