Insulin is a peptide hormone secreted by the beta cells of the pancreas. It regulates blood sugar levels throughout the body through absorption of glucose into liver, fat, and skeletal cells. This is done with glucose transporters that allow glucose to diffuse into the cells. This allows insulin to regulate metabolism of carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. Structurally, insulin is composed of an A chain and a B chain, and a C peptide is cleaved from the molecule when it is formed.
