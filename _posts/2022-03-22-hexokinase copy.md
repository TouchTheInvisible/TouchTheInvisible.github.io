Hexokinase is an enzyme involved in energy metabolism as it phosphorylates hexose in the rate-limiting step of glycolysis. Once it catalyzes the transfer of the phosphate group, the new product glucose-6-phosphate must be used in an energy metabolic pathway including glycolysis, storage, or pentose phosphate pathway. Hexokinase is allosterically inhibited by its product if there are high levels of glucose-6-phosphate present in the cell. It is found in bacterial, fungal, plant, and animal cells especially in the tissues with high energy demands, such as heart, skeletal, and adipose tissues.
