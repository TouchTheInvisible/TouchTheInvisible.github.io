Catabolite Activator Protein (also known as cAMP receptor protein, CRP) activates transcription of more than a hundred promoters, allowing for synthesis of various enzymes required for degradation of non-glucose molecules. Structurally, it forms a homodimer with a DNA binding site, a cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), and an RNA polymerase. The cAMP acts as an allosteric regulator to activate CAP, promoting expression of metabolic genes. For example, in bacteria (such as _E. coli_), the CAP activation is essential for Lac operon expression, allowing for production of Î²-galactosidase, an enzyme that breaks down milk sugar (lactose to make it available for cellular energy metabolism.
