Catabolite Activator Protein (also known as CAP) contains a binding site for DNA and a binding site for cyclic AMP, also known as cAMP. cAMP acts as an allosteric regulator and increases CAPs binding affinity for DNA when bound. CAP activates the lac operon, allowing for the transcription of permease and beta-galactosidase, important molecules in the breakdown of lactose and glucose regulation.
