*Bridging Physical and Digital Modeling of Biological Macromolecules*


## What is this?
Touch the Invisible is a free and open-source educational resource intended to help students learn about complex biological macromolecules. While the main resources for this project are the 3D printed molecular structures that students can interact with in a classroom, the team here at Touch the Invisible recognizes that not everyone has access to the physical models all the time. In addition to providing instructions and the files used to 3D print the models, Touch the Invisible hosts a catalog of supplementary materials that can be used in conjunction with physical models or by themselves. Some of the resources are described below.

## Technology in Use
TouchTheInvisible uses a number of open source projects to work properly:
- [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)
- [Online 3D Viewer](https://github.com/kovacsv/Online3DViewer)
- [UCSF Chimera](https://www.rbvi.ucsf.edu/chimera/)
- [Twitter Bootstrap](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap)
- [NetlifyCMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/)
- [jQuery](https://jquery.com/)
