<meta name="description" content="DNA is a hereditary molecule that stores genetic information for all organisms and some viruses. It also serves as a blueprint for the cellular production of proteins and regulatory molecules. DNA is a nucleic acid polymer build from 4 different nucleotides – adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), and thymine (T). Structurally, it folds into a double helix with a sugar phosphate backbone on the outside and nitrogenous bases on the inside. Complementary bases (A-T, C-G) form hydrogen bonds within the core of the double helix. DNA is found in the nucleus of eukaryotes, in the nucleoids of bacteria, and in the capsids of DNA viruses.">
