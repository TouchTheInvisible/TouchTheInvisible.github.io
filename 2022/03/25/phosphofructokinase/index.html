<meta name="description" content="Phosphofructokinase is a key enzymes regulating glycolysis, a carbohydrate metabolism energy pathway. It catalyzes the 3rd step of glycolysis when it transfers a phosphoryl group from ATP to a fructose-6-phosphate, producing fructose 1,6-bisphosphate. It is allosterically inhibited by the product of the metabolic pathway (mechanism known as feedback inhibition): when cellular levels of ATP are high, ATP binds to the allosteric site and inhibits PFK, stopping glycolysis and ATP production. PFK is found in the cytoplasm of bacterial, plant, fungal, and animal cells. Humans produce several isoforms of PFK, depending on the energetic needs of particular cellular tissue.">
