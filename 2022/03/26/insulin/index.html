<meta name="description" content="Insulin is a peptide hormone secreted by the beta cells of pancreas. As a signaling molecule, it prompts cells to uptake glucose, effectively decreasing glucose levels in the blood. Cells respond to this signal by incorporating glucose transporters (GLUTs) into their membranes. Glucose diffuses through GLUTs into the cells and is immediately metabolized or stored for later use in the form of glycogen in liver and muscle tissue. Initially, insulin is made of 110 amino acids, but after cellular processing, the mature monomer consists of 51 amino acids, making it one of the smallest proteins in the human body. Insulin is stored in hexamer structures coordinated by central zinc ions.">
