<meta name="description" content="La-related protein 1 (LARP1) is a conserved RNA-binding protein that plays a key role in post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression. LARP1 specifically binds to TOP mRNA targets to regulate their stability and translation. Canonically LARP1 has a repressive role in translation of TOP mRNA, but they have been found to be upregulated in some cancers suggesting an unknown activation role. Because of their prevalence in cancers, LARP1 is a novel target for many studies.">
